With your team you’ll have a week to (re-)design an editorial website, for a magazine or newspaper of your choosing.

In this project you’ll be putting more information architecture, content strategy, and responsive layouts into practice. You’ll also be responsible for coding two of the templates using HTML and CSS so that you can properly demonstrate how the layout will change on different size screens.

## Getting Started

1. As a team, quickly decide on an existing publication that you’d like to design a website for. If they already have a website, you’ll be redesigning it. If they only exist in print, you’ll be designing their first website.
2. Audit the existing content. It will probably be too time-consuming to perform an exhaustive audit, so focus on breadth as supposed to depth.
3. Do some card sorting to figure out a sensible navigation for the content. Prepare cards with a subset of articles across a variety of sections of the publication. Each card should have a title and perhaps the first sentence or two of the article so that your test subjects will know what that content is about. You’ll want about 50 cards to perform a good set of open and closed card sorts.
4. Once you’ve got a good handle on how the site will be organized, start sketching screens. I recommend working on mobile layouts first, as it will be easier to scale these designs up than to scale desktop designs down. Start with core parts of the site first, like an individual article or the subscription sign-up form.

## Content Audit

You’ll want to inventory and audit that content to determine:

* how the content should be organized
* what content to keep, cut, or edit
* how users can navigate the site
* what’s the most important content for users

## Setup

* Teams of 2–3
* 4 class days

## Materials

* Sketch
* Invision
* Principle

## Project Scope

Remember that this is a responsive redesign which means that your users will be able to access this website from any device with a web browser. Your design should be robust and flexible to accommodate this variety. _It’s your job as designers to offer a good experience to your user, not their job to bring the right device to your experience._

## Deliverables

* High fidelity re-design of the website for **two** devices <small>(mobile and desktop/laptop)</small>
* Working prototype of at least one target size <small>(with representative screens of the other)</small>
* Style Tile
* Presentation of iterations and final proposal

## Suggestions

* Break down the **content** of the website
* **Start at low fidelity** and work your way up
* Create a **style tile** early to develop colors and type you can use later to make your hi-fi mockups
* Design **mobile first**
* Create **variations of each screen** to improve your odds of finding a design that works
* **Timebox** your work
* Get feedback early & often
* Iterate
* Perfect is the enemy of good
* Build out your presentation deck as you go
* Work fast; have fun

## Presentation (6 minutes)

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What variations on your design did your group explore?
2. How does your design is improving the existing site being re-designed?
3. What would you do differently next time?

## Bonus

Add some animation to your redesign.

## Give feedback to your peers!
